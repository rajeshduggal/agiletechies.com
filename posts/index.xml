      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile works well for projects that have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A low cost of change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems that are discovered along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informally specified goals, that could alter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more traditional approach might be a better option when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of change is high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complete set of problems are known up-front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goals are very specific and fully understood from the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert C. Martin says that Agile is a small idea about the small problem of small programming teams doing small things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is not a big idea about the big problem of big programming teams doing big things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big things don’t get done by big teams; big things get done by the collaboration of many small teams doing many small things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help popularize this, back in the early 2000s, the idea was given a name. “Agile.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
