      <title>Story Points</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/story-points/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/story-points/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Story points are a simple, relative way to size work. We don&amp;rsquo;t size purely in hours, instead we compare one story to another: is this &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;about the same&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;much larger&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointing becomes more precise over time. The key is to establish a tight feedback loop. Early estimates are imprecise, and that&amp;rsquo;s OK. As we work through our iterations we continue to deliver, measure, and recalibrate our point sizing. And that quick adjust-and-learn cycle transforms vagueness into useful predictability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trivariate Estimates</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/trivariate-estimates/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/trivariate-estimates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For big tasks I use trivariate estimates - three numbers: &lt;strong&gt;best‑case&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;nominal‑case&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;worst‑case&lt;/strong&gt;. Each number is a confidence estimate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best‑case (5%)&lt;/strong&gt;: only 5% of similar tasks finish this fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominal‑case (50%)&lt;/strong&gt;: about half the tasks finish by this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worst‑case (95%)&lt;/strong&gt;: 95% confidence the task finishes by this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: &amp;ldquo;I’m 5% sure we&amp;rsquo;ll finish in 1 week, 50% sure in 2 weeks, and 95% sure in 3 weeks.&amp;rdquo;
That means out of 100 similar tasks, ~5 finish in 1 week, ~50 in 2 weeks, and ~95 in 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimates are Intentionally Imprecise</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/estimates-are-intentionally-imprecise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/estimates-are-intentionally-imprecise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An estimate is a guess about how long the work will take - made without actually doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate needs to provide us some value, so it can&amp;rsquo;t just come out of thin air. But it also doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be exactly right and take weeks and weeks to determine. There is a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want that guess to be cheap (spending as little time as possible to make it), so we can get on with the actual work. And because of that estimates are intentionally imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accept Work and Own It</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/accept-work-and-own-it/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/accept-work-and-own-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a builder you have the right to accept work, not have it forced on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s OK to kindly refuse it if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate for you and it might better for someone else to take on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! When you accept a task, you also accept the responsibility that goes along with it. That means you own the quality and delivery, you keep your estimates up to date, you tell the team the status, and you ask for help when needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Own Your Estimates</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/own-your-estimates/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/own-your-estimates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all get to make and update our own estimates.  We know the work best, so no one else should be guessing for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Estimates&amp;rdquo; are educated guesses - useful, but not concrete &amp;ldquo;promises&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re open to change as we learn new things.  And when we do, we can change the estimate and let the team know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good estimating means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We give our best guess, honestly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use ranges when unsure (e.g., 3–7 days).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We update estimates as facts change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We treat estimates as planning tools, not deadlines to blame people for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussions for your team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ask For Help</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/ask-for-help/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/ask-for-help/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Help&amp;rdquo; can be many things: asking a colleague to review some code, asking a teammate to pair while resolving a bug, asking a  manager to help remove a blocker, or asking a customer to clarify some requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for help enables us to move faster and make fewer mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it important for us to ask for help, it&amp;rsquo;s also important for us to respond to help requests too!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cutting Corners</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/cutting-corners/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/cutting-corners/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Builders shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be put in a position where they&amp;rsquo;re forced to cut corners, rush out sloppy work, or compromise their professional standards. The business does not get to demand low quality or ask others to risk their reputation or ethics for a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a task would force someone to do poor work, they must feel safe to raise the issue, explain the risks, and insist on a better alternate approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Give the Builders Knowledge</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/give-the-builders-knowledge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Builders need clarity on what to build and which things matter the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to make sure they have simple listed priorities, and clear requirements so the team can plan and do the work. We&amp;rsquo;re not aiming for perfection. That isn&amp;rsquo;t possible. Instead we describe and explain any uncertainty up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the team is working inside an iteration, priorities should stay reasonably stable so the builders can finish without constant interruptions. And outside the iteration, the priorities can change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Customers Can&#39;t Demand Fixed Scope &amp; Fixed Time</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/customers-manage-the-schedule/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/customers-manage-the-schedule/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Customers do not have the right to insist on fixed scope on an immovable date. They do have the right to manage the schedule by changing scope. The most important right here is the right to know—timely visibility that a date is at risk so informed trade-offs can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honoring this right enables change to become a competitive advantage, not a project’s undoing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Customers Right to Cancel, and Keep Value</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/customers-right-to-cancel-and-keep-value/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/customers-right-to-cancel-and-keep-value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because value is delivered in working, tested increments, customers may stop at any time and still retain a useful system that reflects the investment to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only possible if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every iteration ends with integrated, shippable software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation, telemetry, and operational handoffs keep the system usable without the team.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How to Keep Change Affordable</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/how-to-keep-change-affordable/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/how-to-keep-change-affordable/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keep change affordable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short iterations and small stories: Reduce the blast radius of any decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous integration and delivery: Keep the product always releasable so swapping scope is easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated tests and refactoring: Make code safe to change; the test suite proves we didn’t break value already delivered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modular architecture and clear seams: Localize change instead of rewriting the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature flags and branch-by-abstraction: Enable gradual rollouts and safe reversals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backlog hygiene and ROI-driven ordering: Replace lower-ROI work with higher-ROI work at minimal switching cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WIP limits: Less inventory in flight means less rework when priorities shift.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Change Is a Right, Not a Penalty</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/change-is-a-right-not-a-penalty/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/change-is-a-right-not-a-penalty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software is meant to change. Customers have the right to change their minds, substitute functionality, and re-order priorities without paying exorbitant costs. Agile assumes change and designs both the product and the process to make change economically reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &amp;ldquo;reasonable, not exorbitant&amp;rdquo; means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change isn’t free; it should be cheap enough to make good business sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs are kept low by technical excellence and small-batch planning, not by refusing change.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Incremental Value for the Customers</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/incremental-value-for-the-customers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The customers have the right to expect that builders tackle the most important work each cycle and deliver maximum &lt;strong&gt;usable&lt;/strong&gt; business value. They choose the stories with the highest return on investment that fit the builders&amp;rsquo; estimates during planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers also have the right to see progress in a &lt;strong&gt;running system&lt;/strong&gt;, not just slide decks or status reports. They specify the acceptance criteria, and a suite of repeatable tests prove that the criteria is met.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Customers&#39; Right to a Plan</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/customers-right-to-a-plan/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/customers-right-to-a-plan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scope Soft or Dates Soft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myth: agile software development skips planning. Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers have the &lt;strong&gt;right to a plan&lt;/strong&gt; - what can be done, when, and at what cost. The business needs this to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! being both accurate &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; precise requires actually building the project. Anything less is guesswork. So builders must describe uncertainty honestly using &lt;strong&gt;probability curves&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t promise fixed scope on hard dates, either scope or dates must flex. So instead we provide some kind of probability predicting estimations: &amp;ldquo;95% confidence we finish the first ten stories by the date, 50% for the next five, 5% for the five after that.&amp;rdquo;  And these numbers change continually shift as each days go by.  Sometimes the the schedule is very precise and at other times it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat soft.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who Are The Customers?</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/who-are-the-customers/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/who-are-the-customers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t just the person clicking buttons. Generally, the &amp;ldquo;customer&amp;rdquo; label can be assigned to &lt;strong&gt;anyone with skin in the game&lt;/strong&gt; — end users, managers, executives, project leaders, and anyone carrying responsibility for scheduling, budgets, and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because all of these people have legitimate overlapping needs and rights. Which might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project manager needs a plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The executive needs cost visibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end user needs working features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The product owner needs priority control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we treat only one group as &amp;ldquo;the customer,&amp;rdquo; other voices get ignored and trust breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Business-Builder Divide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kent Beck said the goal of agile software development is to heal the divide between the business and development, and he was right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bill of Rights - created by Kent, Ward Cunningham, Ron Jeffries, and others — defines complementary expectations: the customer&amp;rsquo;s rights and the builder&amp;rsquo;s rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When both sides know their rights and honor the other&amp;rsquo;s, collaboration replaces conflict. The customer has the right to a plan, to see progress, and to change priorities. Builders have the right to know what&amp;rsquo;s needed, to produce quality work, and to ask for help. These aren&amp;rsquo;t rules, they&amp;rsquo;re agreements that create balance and trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things move fast, if you stop learning, the product and the team will fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find ways to grow: When the company can afford look for suitable, high ROI courses, books, and conferences.  And teach what you learn. Teaching cements knowledge and spreads it across the team. Make knowledge sharing part of the workflow so new people ramp quickly and everyone improves together. The &amp;ldquo;Whole Team&amp;rdquo; practice supports this type of thinking: continuous learning and teaching are core to a resilient, adaptive team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When the Answer is No</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/when-the-answer-is-no/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve joined teams that have a pervasive team culture of always saying &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; when asked about the feasibility of the schedule, even when the real answer is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a professional, it&amp;rsquo;s our duty to say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; when something can&amp;rsquo;t be done. We aren&amp;rsquo;t only hired to deliver, we&amp;rsquo;re also here to surface technical reality. As builders, we are the ones who know whether an approach is feasible or not, and if it can be completed within the allocated timeframe and budget; when it&amp;rsquo;s not, it&amp;rsquo;s vital that we speak up, even when under schedule pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Estimate Isn&#39;t a Promise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most honest estimate answer is &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&amp;rdquo; That’s useful — but incomplete. Good estimates mix what you know and what you don&amp;rsquo;t. A common technique is to use relative comparisons (e.g. The estimate to build &amp;ldquo;Change Password&amp;rdquo; is about half of building &amp;ldquo;Login&amp;rdquo;), another technique is to use probability ranges (&amp;ldquo;between 5 to 15 days, most likely 12 days&amp;rdquo;). Both of these approaches can give managers, product owners, and stakeholders some meaningful information without pretending certainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within a team if a player falls, the team needs to step up and cover the gap and keep the ball moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bob gets sick, Jill steps in to finish Bob&amp;rsquo;s work. But this can only happen when Jill knows what Bob was doing and where to find his code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need to cross-train deliberately and make sure important knowledge isn&amp;rsquo;t siloed to just one or two people. And we need to encourage each team member to make it &lt;strong&gt;their&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility to ensure other teammates can cover for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>QA Finds Nothing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Testing a Non‑Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our day to day lives, the quality of our efforts are our own responsibility. Yet, in most software teams there&amp;rsquo;s a dedicated group of special people to take some of that responsibility away from the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds strange to hear it described that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is a QA phase, then it should be the norm to hear that &amp;ldquo;Everything works.&amp;rdquo; And in those rare circumstances when QA finds a fault, the builders should ask, &amp;ldquo;What in our process let this slip?&amp;rdquo; and fix that process so that next time QA will find nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fear Removal Button</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/fear-removal-button/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a button that lights green if the system works and red if it breaks - and it returns results in seconds. You&amp;rsquo;d probably press it after every tiny change. That fast feedback would remove fear and makes cleaning code feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When feedback is immediate, you can &lt;code&gt;Refactor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Pair&lt;/code&gt;, and apply &lt;code&gt;Simple Design&lt;/code&gt; without dread. The Agile practice of &lt;code&gt;TDD&lt;/code&gt; (Test-Driven Development) enables this button: tests become the quick signal that lets builders improve the code continuously. And with that habit, the team becomes fearlessly competent and the codebase steadily gets better over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Let Fear Steal Improvement</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/dont-let-fear-steal-improvement/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/dont-let-fear-steal-improvement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common reasons systems don&amp;rsquo;t improve is the &lt;em&gt;fear of change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see ugly code and think, &amp;ldquo;I should clean it,&amp;rdquo; then we stop because we&amp;rsquo;re afraid we&amp;rsquo;ll break it — and if we break it, it becomes ours. This fear freezes teams, lets messes grow, and erodes competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers, users, and managers expect &lt;em&gt;fearless competence&lt;/em&gt;: when we see dirt, we clean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make cleaning a regular routine on-going activity by reducing the risks — fast automated feedback, small safe refactors, pairing, and continuous integration. When we&amp;rsquo;re able to clean confidently the code will naturally improve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/keep-getting-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our software should improve with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painters refine paintings and homeowners improve houses - our software should get better, not worse, as we work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous improvement means the architecture, code, and performance progressively mature. If we accept creeping cruft and brittle designs, we betray our users and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s make daily habits of pairing, TDD, refactoring, and simple design. These practices let help us to steadily reduce technical debt, increase throughput, and make the system safer to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keep Software Easy to Change</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/keep-software-easy-to-change/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the software is hard to change, we&amp;rsquo;ve defeated its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers, users, and managers rightly expect that changes are straightforward and proportionate in cost. When change becomes costly, trust and velocity evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix is practical, not mystical.  Make change cheap by practicing TDD, continuous refactoring, and simple design. Tests give us safety to refactor. Refactoring keeps the codebase healthy. Simple design prevents unnecessary coupling. Together these habits make systems that bend without breaking and let builders deliver value rapidly and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/celebrate-change-its-why-were-here/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in this team to make changes. It&amp;rsquo;s not a nuisance - it&amp;rsquo;s the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our careers and our value come from making change cheap and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means designing for adaptability, writing tests that protect refactors, keeping designs simple, and automating where we can. We celebrate change by making it routine: small batches, continuous refactoring, and visible tests so every builder can evolve the system without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we make change inexpensive, the business gets faster feedback, customers get better products, and builders do the work we were hired to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Software Is Supposed To Be Soft</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/software-is-supposed-to-be-soft/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/software-is-supposed-to-be-soft/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software exists to be changed. &amp;ldquo;Ware&amp;rdquo; means product; &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; means easy to change. If our systems are hard to alter, we&amp;rsquo;ve turned software into hardware by mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When requirements shift and builders complain, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;That change breaks our architecture,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s a clear indication that the architecture sucks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace change as the point of the work. We make change inexpensive by focusing on tests, refactoring, simple design, and pairing. And we build architectures that bend without snapping so the team can deliver value continuously instead of fighting the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Does Your Code-base teach?</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/what-does-your-codebase-teach/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/what-does-your-codebase-teach/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your codebase is one of the team&amp;rsquo;s primary teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New people don&amp;rsquo;t learn from manuals, they learn by reading the existing code and copying its habits. If the code is messy, newcomers adopt those same messy habits. And adding heads only multiplies the problem: more people results in more copies of the same bad patterns, and so productivity keeps sliding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen managers repeat the same fix — hire more — and expect different results. But that rarely works. The real solution is to change what the code teaches: make it readability, testable, and make refactoring a norm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/continuous-cleanup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We want steady velocity, not wild swings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed how early in our projects we fly; but later, code messes pile up. That mess creates back pressure - the bigger the mess, the slower our team goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then our slow team faces even more schedule pressure, which encourages quick hacks that make the mess worse. That feedback loop can grind the team toward immobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; is often, to add more people, but the new hires learn from the existing messy code base, and they often take on the same behaviors that produced it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make Deployment a Business Decision</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/make-deployment-a-business-decision/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some teams create a &amp;ldquo;stabilization&amp;rdquo; window after a sprint because features are half done, half tested, or half documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delivery delay frustrates customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better approach is to have systems in place that enables our software to always be &lt;em&gt;technically deployable&lt;/em&gt; at the end of every iteration. From the builders&amp;rsquo; point of view that means code is clean, tests pass, documentation up to date, and the implemented stories are stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Focus on Finishing, Not Starting</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/focus-on-finsihing-not-starting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to focus on delivering value quickly rather than starting something early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing customers and managers expect is that it&amp;rsquo;s common for software building teams to unintentionally create artificial delays. Yet teams do this all the time by trying to build every feature at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half‑done or half‑tested features pile up and prevent deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead it&amp;rsquo;s better to prioritize the most important features first and finish them end‑to‑end. Deliver vertical slices and only call it &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; when an the code, the tests, and the docs are finalized. And consider using feature toggles when you must decouple rollout from completion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We Will Not Ship Crap: The Builder&#39;s Promise</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/we-will-not-ship-crap/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/we-will-not-ship-crap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a team we should expect one simple thing from our work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will not ship crap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers, customers, and users reasonably expect high-quality systems with few defects. When we slack on quality, we betray that trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team must push practices that stop bad code: testing, refactoring, simple design, and continuous customer feedback. These are not ceremonies — they&amp;rsquo;re tools that make quality repeatable. Builders should treat them as nonnegotiable habits, not optional extras. Doing so keeps our work dependable and our reputation intact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look around now - how many computers are in the room?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I count about thirty. Phones, the TV, my dyson heater, my headset, my oura ring, remote controls : nearly everything with a button on it runs software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That matters because &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; one of those devices needs code written by teams likes yours. Software touches law, health, transport, and food systems. And small mistakes can cascade into real harm. As software builders, we must treat our craft as responsible work: design carefully, test relentlessly, and assume our code has consequences beyond the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Upping Our Game: Professionalism</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/professionalism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile development prizes discipline over ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a promise to raise our craft and to foster professional behavior across all aspects of software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen teams ship junk, and just casually accept defects, and make poor lazy trade-offs. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising to see some of those habits being tolerated at some organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want respect for our work, quality and discipline must be nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussions for your team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we being professional and constantly finding opportunities to pair, clean out tech debt, and refactor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do our cycles produce quality (almost) bug free output each time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What practices are we following to prevent unsafe or low-quality releases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are we guiding our team to continually improve our level of professionalism?&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the agile processes, Extreme Programming (XP) is the clearest, most complete, and least muddled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other software developerment approaches that were invented afterwards are a subset of - or a variation on XP. I don’t dismiss those approaches; some fit specific projects types. But when I want my builders to learn what the original agile software development approach was about, I point them to XP as a great template to start with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/business-value-order/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Want to stop wasting time building the wrong thing. Every iteration ask the stakeholders,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;what should we build next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They answer in business-value order, and we implement in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, features have dependencies — we&amp;rsquo;re builders; we handle them. The point is simple: let stakeholders decide priority so the team can focus on delivering value. When stakeholders say a feature is low value, we don&amp;rsquo;t build it yet. When they point to something critical, we give it attention first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When &#34;All of it by New Year&#34; Meets the Data</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/when-all-of-it-by-new-year-meets-the-data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had the project stakeholders demand everything by a fixed date?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell them plainly — &lt;em&gt;if you want every feature, the timeline will stretch.&lt;/em&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t argue; Show the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stakeholders insist, ask them to choose: accept a later date or reduce scope. In rational organizations the numbers win: teams deliver what&amp;rsquo;s prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help the stakeholders &lt;em&gt;scrutinize&lt;/em&gt; the plan, identify what truly must ship by the deadline, and gently defer the rest. It hurts to drop features, but real choices beat false promises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/go-fast-by-going-well/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to finish is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to cut corners — it&amp;rsquo;s to raise the bar on quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick‑and‑dirty doesn&amp;rsquo;t speeds things up. &lt;strong&gt;Trash code, missing tests, skipped reviews - they slow the team down.&lt;/strong&gt; When technical debt accumulates, every change takes longer, bugs multiply, and momentum dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead do things well: keep tests in the flow, do reviews, refactor relentlessly, and protect sustainable work practices. These habits look slower at first, but they pay back quickly in reduced rework and faster, safer delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should We Add More Builders?</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/should-we-add-more-builders/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/should-we-add-more-builders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Piling in fresh people onto a late project is rarely the quick fix managers hope for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks&amp;rsquo; Law is real:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;adding manpower to a late project makes it later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new people arrive, productivity usually plunges while the team absorbs them. Veterans spend time teaching instead of building, and team recovery is slow moving - if it does at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring can help over the long haul, but as a fast remedy it&amp;rsquo;s a gamble. Often budgets won&amp;rsquo;t allow more staff, so the practical levers are &lt;strong&gt;scope, quality,&lt;/strong&gt; and how the current team works together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/kill-the-hope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s our job to &lt;em&gt;kill dangerous hope early&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope&lt;/strong&gt; lets teams give optimistic answers that hide real progress. That&amp;rsquo;s how projects quietly fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we should aim to gather hard data every iteration so managers, product owners, and stakeholders can make real decisions instead of wishful guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t about going faster - it&amp;rsquo;s about learning the truth as soon as possible so we can &lt;strong&gt;manage&lt;/strong&gt; trade‑offs effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivering hard facts quickly gives us options; clinging to hope removes them. I encourage teams to treat iteration feedback as a tool for making pragmatic, timely choices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/rhythm-not-sequence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile development isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;Waterfall sliced into smaller pieces&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often we treat iterations like mini-projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis at the start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding in the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing at the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not Agile — that&amp;rsquo;s Waterfall on shuffle mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In true Agile development, &lt;strong&gt;requirements, architecture, design, and implementation happen continuously throughout the iteration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn → adjust → build → validate → repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flow isn&amp;rsquo;t a sequence — it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;rhythm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When starting a project, it’s tempting to grab every shiny tool—MongoDB, Kafka, React, Terraform. But each one adds cost: learning, debugging, lock‑in, maintenance, and version headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cheapest tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using it. (Yet!)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-simple&#34;&gt;Start Simple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin with the plainest possible solution. Before installing a database, ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can text files work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can a folder of binaries work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can an in‑memory map power the prototype?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, you can go surprisingly far without extra tools. And when you finally need one, you’ll choose it based on real needs—not guesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Teams Don&#39;t Split Huge Stories</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/why-teams-dont-split-huge-stories/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/why-teams-dont-split-huge-stories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A team creates a user story for a full calendar feature. The PO, BA, UX, and accessibility SME add pages of detail so developers have everything they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When developers see the ticket, they know it’s far too big. It needs splitting—but rewriting all that detail feels time‑consuming, inconvenient, and no one volunteers to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the team decides to work on the giant story as-is and &amp;ldquo;figure out the rest later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Does Your Team Avoid Updating Code Comments?</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/does-your-team-avoid-updating-code-comments/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/does-your-team-avoid-updating-code-comments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something to discuss with your team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re working on a ticket, deep in your own task. Then you notice something odd: in a completely unrelated part of the codebase, the comments don&amp;rsquo;t match what the code actually does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone changed the logic earlier but forgot to update the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine this was your &lt;strong&gt;solo project&lt;/strong&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;d probably just fix the comment right away. Write a quick update, commit it, done. How long would that take? A couple of minutes, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-cost-of-too-much-process&#34;&gt;The Hidden Cost of Too Much Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many teams fall into the trap of &lt;em&gt;Runaway Process Inflation&lt;/em&gt;.  They start with simple workflows, then gradually adding more steps in the name of efficiency. Yet each new step can subtly slow delivery instead of helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More process doesn’t always mean more effectiveness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before adding a checklist, approval, or workflow gate, consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this help us deliver working software faster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it speed up feedback or slow it down?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it improve decisions or just add paperwork?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are we solving a real issue or simply creating the illusion of control?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-essential-question&#34;&gt;The Essential Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will this affect our ability to get changes in front of customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Makes The Velocity Chart Useful</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/useful-velocity-chart/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/useful-velocity-chart/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Velocity Chart records how many story points are completed in each iteration sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important chart to have, and I recommend it to all my clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the team creates user stories, they are added to the backlog. At some point, those stories need to move into the current sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how many stories should we move into the sprint? We won’t know until we’ve done some basic estimations to get an idea of how many we should pull from the top of the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Velocity Chart Problem</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/velocity-chart-problem/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Velocity Chart records how many story points are completed during each iteration sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important chart to have, and I recommend it to all my clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that many teams use this chart incorrectly. They try to use it to measure how much work the team should aim to complete in the next sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the sprint, this can create pressure on the team to work faster to meet that objective (often by secretly compromising on quality). Alternatively, it can cause the team to slow down and stretch their work pace so that their last bit of work aligns with the sprint end date. This way, they avoid closing all their tickets and being left with nothing to report in the daily meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scientific Management (Taylorism)</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/scientific-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/scientific-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we had the light-weight agile type of development approaches there were two modes of thinking about how software should be built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light-weight approach (agile before it was called “agile”) worked well for projects that enjoyed a low cost of change, and solved partially defined problems with informally specified goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other perspective was more aligned with “Scientific Management” which worked best for projects that suffered a high cost of change and solved very well-defined problems with extremely specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sprint Or Marathon?</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/sprint-or-marathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/sprint-or-marathon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not particularly fond of the term &amp;ldquo;sprint&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;sprint&amp;rdquo; often gives the impression that the team needs to prioritize on working as fast as possible. And inadvertently creates pressure to complete every user story before the end of the sprint, sometimes at the expense of quality, or by allowing technical debt to build up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, agile development is more like a marathon, where we maintain a healthy, steady, sustainable pace. It’s not a relay race where teams sprint as fast as they can, trying not to drop the baton at the end of each leg.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which Projects Work Well With Agile?</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/which-projects-work-well-with-agile/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/which-projects-work-well-with-agile/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agile works well for projects that have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A low cost of change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems that are discovered along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informally specified goals, that could alter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more traditional approach might be a better option when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of change is high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complete set of problems are known up-front.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goals are very specific and fully understood from the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>The Iron Triangle</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/iron-triangle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iron Cross&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Have you heard of the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iron Triangle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality (Deliver what&amp;rsquo;s expected. And account for all of the exceptional scenarios flows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope (How much stuff is delivered)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources (Time, brains, tools, dollars, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick any two, and the third is a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, we will want “Quality” to be maxed out. So, we can only focus on “Scope” or “Resources.” If we want a larger scope of work completed, we need to increase the resources. Alternatively, if resources are fixed, we must accept and define how much scope of work we can realistically complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Iron Cross&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt; (Quality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Delivered) &lt;strong&gt;Fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap&lt;/strong&gt; (Under budget)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Everything) &lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on any three you like, but you can’t have the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a project that is &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; quality, delivered on time &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;, and within budget and &lt;strong&gt;cheap&lt;/strong&gt;. But! not everything will get &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, you can have a project that is all &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;cheap&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt;, but it won’t be &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Elephant in the Room: Agile Workflow Incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://agiletechies.com/posts/elephant-in-the-room-agile-workflow-incompatibility/</link>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/elephant-in-the-room-agile-workflow-incompatibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to not assume that the software your team is working is compatible with an agile workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is about &lt;em&gt;embracing change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for that to happen, the software itself needs to be intentionally designed with adaptability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve joined many teams where the management and scrum master were on-board with following an agile approach, but they were   completely oblivious to the fact that the software being built wasn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with an agile workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the Agile Software Development Approach?</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>rajesh@duggalmail.com (Raj Duggal)</author>
      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/what-is-the-agile-software-development-approach/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The agile software development approach consists of working through a development project as a series of short, focused cycles. Often called &amp;ldquo;iterations&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;sprints&amp;rdquo;. After each iteration, the team evaluates the results and adjusts the plan as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high level concept of Agile is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver value first:&lt;/strong&gt;
Features are built in the order of business value, ensuring the most valuable work is completed first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintaining high quality:&lt;/strong&gt;
Quality is a top priority throughout the development process, not just at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Agile Is a Small Idea</title>

      <guid>https://agiletechies.com/posts/agile-is-a-small-idea/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert C. Martin says that Agile is a small idea about the small problem of small programming teams doing small things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is not a big idea about the big problem of big programming teams doing big things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big things don’t get done by big teams; big things get done by the collaboration of many small teams doing many small things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help popularize this, back in the early 2000s, the idea was given a name. “Agile.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
