One of the most common reasons systems don't improve is the _fear of change_.

We see ugly code and think, "I should clean it," then we stop because we're afraid we'll break it — and if we break it, it becomes ours. This fear freezes teams, lets messes grow, and erodes competence.

Customers, users, and managers expect *fearless competence*: when we see dirt, we clean it.

We can make cleaning a regular routine on-going activity by reducing the risks — fast automated feedback, small safe refactors, pairing, and continuous integration. When we're able to clean confidently the code will naturally improve.

__Discussions for your team__
* Which parts of the software are we avoiding to touch?
* Do we have fast test feedback to make our refactorings safe?  
* Who in the team is responsible for cleaning messy code?  
* What small code cleanup can we do this week?
