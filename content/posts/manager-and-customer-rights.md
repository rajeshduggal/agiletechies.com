1 You have the right to an overall plan and to know what can be
  accomplished when and at what cost.

2 You have the right to get the most possible value out of every
  week.

3 You have the right to see progress in a running system, proven to work
  by passing repeatable tests that you specify.

4 You have the right to change your mind, to substitute functionality,
  and to change priorities without paying exorbitant costs.

5 You have the right to be informed of schedule and estimate changes, in
  time to choose how to reduce scope to restore the original date. You
  can cancel at any time and be left with a useful working system
  reflecting investment to date.

__Discussions for your team__
* Do stakeholders know what we can deliver, when, and at what cost?
* Can the customers use the new working software features regularly?
* How expensive is it for stakeholders to change priorities?
* Do we inform stakeholders early when estimates shift?
