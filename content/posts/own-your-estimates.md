We all get to make and update our own estimates.  We know the work best, so no one else should be guessing for us.

__"Estimates" are educated guesses - useful, but not concrete "promises".__

They're open to change as we learn new things.  And when we do, we can change the estimate and let the team know.

Good estimating means:
* We give our best guess, honestly.
* We use ranges when unsure (e.g., 3–7 days).
* We update estimates as facts change.
* We treat estimates as planning tools, not deadlines to blame people for.

__Discussions for your team__
* Who owns each estimate and how do we record updates?
* When should an estimate be revised and who must be notified?
* In what situations do we use ranges versus single numbers? Which work better?
* How do we keep estimates from becoming blame?
