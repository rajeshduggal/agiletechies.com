Imagine a button that lights green if the system works and red if it breaks - and it returns results in seconds. You'd probably press it after every tiny change. That fast feedback would remove fear and makes cleaning code feel safe.

When feedback is immediate, you can `Refactor`, `Pair`, and apply `Simple Design` without dread. The Agile practice of `TDD` (Test-Driven Development) enables this button: tests become the quick signal that lets builders improve the code continuously. And with that habit, the team becomes fearlessly competent and the codebase steadily gets better over time.

__Discussions for the team__
* Do we have fast tests that act like the button?
* Are `Refactoring` and `Pairing` routine for small changes?
* What is the next step we need to take to build our fast "fear removal" button?
