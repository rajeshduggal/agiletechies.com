Agile development isn't "Waterfall sliced into smaller pieces"

Too often we treat iterations like mini-projects:
* Analysis at the start
* Coding in the middle
* Testing at the end

But that's not Agile — that's Waterfall on shuffle mode.

In true Agile development, **requirements, architecture, design, and implementation happen continuously throughout the iteration.**

We learn → adjust → build → validate → repeat.

This flow isn't a sequence — it's a *rhythm*.

Teams that embrace this rhythm deliver better outcomes, reduce rework, and stay aligned with real customer needs.

Stop thinking in phases.

Start thinking in **continuous discovery and continuous delivery**.

Discussion for your team:
* Are team members that specialize in business analysis and design usually busiest at the beginning of the sprint?
* Are team members that specialize in quality assurance busiest at the end of the sprint?
