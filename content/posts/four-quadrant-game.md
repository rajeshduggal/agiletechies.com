How do we choose what to build first?

One approach to help figure this out, is to play a simple four-quadrant game: look at each story’s value and cost.

* Valuable and cheap: do it now.
* Valuable but expensive: do it later.
* Not valuable and cheap: maybe someday.
* Not valuable and expensive: don’t do it.

This is just a guide to get the ball rolling, in some cases the results don't always make sense. For example, *Logout* might be _important and cheap_, so do it; But *Login* may be _important but costly_, so wait;

But _Logout_ only makes sense if _Login_ exists first.

Another example might be if *Withdrawal* is considered costly to build, but it might be decided that it's worth building  early.

Stakeholders pick the highest bang-for-buck until the chosen stories add up to the team's guessed velocity (say 30 points). And that becomes the plan for the iteration.

__Discussions for your team__
* How do we decide what's “valuable”?
* How do we decide when a story is "too expensive"?
* Who needs to "okay" the final list of stories for the iteration?
* When will we work on the postponed high-cost, high-value items?
* How can we validate the ROI at the end of the iteration?
