Of all the agile processes, Extreme Programming (XP) is the clearest, most complete, and least muddled.

Many other software developerment approaches that were invented afterwards are a subset of - or a variation on XP. I don’t dismiss those approaches; some fit specific projects types. But when I want my builders to learn what the original agile software development approach was about, I point them to XP as a great template to start with.  

__Discussions for your team__
* Are there some XP practices the team should consider adopting (pairing, TDD, CI)?  
* Do we have a problem with code ownership getting in the way of cross-learning and creating blockers?
* What small experiment can we run this week to sample a new XP practice in our development approach?
