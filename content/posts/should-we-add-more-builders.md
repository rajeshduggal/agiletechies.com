Piling in fresh people onto a late project is rarely the quick fix managers hope for.

__Brooks' Law is real:__ _adding manpower to a late project makes it later._

When new people arrive, productivity usually plunges while the team absorbs them. Veterans spend time teaching instead of building, and team recovery is slow moving - if it does at all.

Hiring can help over the long haul, but as a fast remedy it's a gamble. Often budgets won't allow more staff, so the practical levers are __scope, quality,__ and how the current team works together.

Focus first on cutting scope to the essentials, protecting your core builders, and improving practices that speed delivery. Treat hiring as a strategic, not a panic, move.

Discussions for your team
* What areas of scope cutting can we do to yield value in the shortest time?
* What onboarding tasks cause the biggest drag?
* Other than growing the team, what changes can we make to speed up value delivery?
* Under what conditions is adding staff worth the onboarding slowdown to the team?
