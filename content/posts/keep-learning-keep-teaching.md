Things move fast, if you stop learning, the product and the team will fall behind.

Find ways to grow: When the company can afford look for suitable, high ROI courses, books, and conferences.  And teach what you learn. Teaching cements knowledge and spreads it across the team. Make knowledge sharing part of the workflow so new people ramp quickly and everyone improves together. The "Whole Team" practice supports this type of thinking: continuous learning and teaching are core to a resilient, adaptive team.

__Discussions for your team__
* Who is leading our next learning session?  
* What resources do we need to learn and teach effectively?  
* How do we pair newcomers with mentors?  
* How can we include deliberate learning into our sprint cadence?
