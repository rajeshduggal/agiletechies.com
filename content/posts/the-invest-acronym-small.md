User stories are reminders of features, not full specifications. Avoid recording every detail up front because details change. We'll capture the details later, when they matter.

When a story reads like a contract, it stops being a conversation.
When it reads like a reminder, it invites one.

Follow the acronym "INVEST" as a quick check.

A story should be doable by one or two builders within a single iteration so no single story can dominate the team.

As a guideline, aim for an iteration that contains about as many stories as there are builders, for an eight-builder team, roughly 6–12 stories.

The goal is steady flow, frequent feedback, and predictable delivery.

__Discussions for your team__
* Do we have too many, or too few stories in our iteration?
* Do we have some large stories that are blocking flow?
