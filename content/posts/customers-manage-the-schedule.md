Customers do not have the right to insist on fixed scope on an immovable date. They do have the right to manage the schedule by changing scope. The most important right here is the right to know—timely visibility that a date is at risk so informed trade-offs can be made.

Honoring this right enables change to become a competitive advantage, not a project’s undoing.
