## The Hidden Cost of Too Much Process

I've seen many teams fall into the trap of _Runaway Process Inflation_.  They start with simple workflows, then gradually adding more steps in the name of efficiency. Yet each new step can subtly slow delivery instead of helping.

> **More process doesn’t always mean more effectiveness.**

Before adding a checklist, approval, or workflow gate, consider:

* Does this help us deliver working software faster?
* Does it speed up feedback or slow it down?
* Does it improve decisions or just add paperwork?
* Are we solving a real issue or simply creating the illusion of control?

### The Essential Question

> **How will this affect our ability to get changes in front of customers?**

Modern teams win through **speed of learning**, not layers of process. Keep workflows lightweight, intentional, and focused on flow and customer value.

Add process thoughtfully. Remove it courageously.

Discussion for your team:

You're working on your current ticket and notice an outdated comment in an older part of the code. Doing the comment fix will take mere seconds.

Scenario 1: If This Were a Solo Project

If you were the only developer on the application:

* What would be the fastest way to get this small fix into the codebase?
* How quickly could it be ready for the next deployment?

Most developers would simply update the comment, commit, push, and move on. No friction. No ceremony.

Scenario 2: Your Team’s Current Workflow

Now compare that to your team’s actual process:

* Do you need to create a new ticket for the fix?
* Does the ticket require refinement or approval?
* Does the PR require multiple reviewers?
* Does QA need to test this change even if it’s non-functional?
* How long does the fix sit in a queue before deployment?
