After planning, we let the builders pick the stories they will own.

It's important to avoid having the managers and leads assign the stories to individuals. Instead we let the team negotiate ownership amongst themselves and encourage pairing, mentoring, and sensible scoping decisions.

__Discussions for your team__
* Are assignments discussed and negotiated, or imposed on individuals?
* Do we encourage pairing on stories, or do individuals take on stories alone?
