At the start of a project, we haven't set a precedent baseline of how to estimate our stories.  So at our initial estimation meetings we can pick one average story as our *Golden Story* and give it a number (say 3). And then we compare the other stories to it: simpler might be 1, harder might be 5 or 6.

Story points measure relative *effort*, not hours. They should be roughly linear but stay fuzzy at first. Write the point estimation onto the story. And keep the story brief. Perhaps just a title and a few short notes.

Over the course of the project we continue to estimate, deliver, then recalibrate; this quick feedback loop is what turns our early imprecision into useful predictability.
