title = "We Will Not Ship Crap: The Builder's Promise"

As a team we should expect one simple thing from our work:

__We will not ship crap__

Managers, customers, and users reasonably expect high-quality systems with few defects. When we slack on quality, we betray that trust.

The team must push practices that stop bad code: testing, refactoring, simple design, and continuous customer feedback. These are not ceremonies — they're tools that make quality repeatable. Builders should treat them as nonnegotiable habits, not optional extras. Doing so keeps our work dependable and our reputation intact.

__Discussions for your team__
* Does the entire team share a "no-crap" quality standard?
* Are we doing enough testing and refactoring?
* Is simplicity guiding our design decisions?
* How quickly do we get customer feedback on increments?
* What gates do we have in place to stop low-quality work from shipping?
