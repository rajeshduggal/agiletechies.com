User stories are reminders of features, not full specifications. Avoid recording every detail up front because details change. We'll capture the details later, when they matter.

When a story reads like a contract, it stops being a conversation.
When it reads like a reminder, it invites one.

Follow the acronym "INVEST" as a quick check.

__VALUABLE__

User story's first job is to be *valuable* to the business.

Refactoring, architecture, and code cleanup are important, but they are not *stories*. A true story delivers measurable business value and usually slices vertically through the system: a bit of GUI, some middleware, and database work.

Keep stories thin and outcome-focused so stakeholders can compare them.

These kinds of stories make planning clearer, negotiation more productive, and every iteration pumps real value.

__Discussions for your team__
* Do we have backlog items that are actually maintenance, but labeled as stories?
* Do our stories slice vertically or are they layer-bound tasks?
* Can we split our stories even smaller, valuable slices?
