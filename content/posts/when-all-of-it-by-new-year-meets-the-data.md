Have you ever had the project stakeholders demand everything by a fixed date?

Tell them plainly — _if you want every feature, the timeline will stretch._ Don't argue; Show the data.

When stakeholders insist, ask them to choose: accept a later date or reduce scope. In rational organizations the numbers win: teams deliver what's prioritized.

Help the stakeholders _scrutinize_ the plan, identify what truly must ship by the deadline, and gently defer the rest. It hurts to drop features, but real choices beat false promises.

Make the trade-offs visible, protect the team's pace, and help builders focus on what delivers value by the deadline.

Discussion points for your team:
* Is the teams velocity/estimates data visible to the stakeholders?.
* Do the stakeholders own scope decisions?
* Is the team keeping their focus within the agreed scope?
