We can look at each iteration as a pump. As each iteration completes, we add the completed velocity to the chart so that everyone can see how fast we're going.

Iteration after iteration the pump draws _ROI_ out of the story deck.
Continuous exploration pumps _ROI_ back in by discovering new, valuable stories.

As long as incoming ROI outpaces outgoing ROI, the project keeps flowing. When exploration slows and new features dry up, the deck's ROI is exhausted.

And then one day in future, at an iteration planning meeting, the stakeholders might scan the deck and find that there's  nothing worth doing, and so it's time to consider that the project might be over.

We keep feeding the deck with value, and when the flow stops the project ends gracefully.

**Discussions for your team**
* Should we track and chart the incoming and outgoing ROI?
* Are we replenishing the story deck consistently?
* How can we know if the deck is drying up?
* When should we declare the project complete?
