When starting a project, it’s tempting to grab every shiny tool—MongoDB, Kafka, React, Terraform. But each one adds cost: learning, debugging, lock‑in, maintenance, and version headaches.

The cheapest tool?

**Not using it. (Yet!)**

## Start Simple

Begin with the plainest possible solution. Before installing a database, ask:

* Can text files work?
* Can a folder of binaries work?
* Can an in‑memory map power the prototype?

Often, you can go surprisingly far without extra tools. And when you finally need one, you’ll choose it based on real needs—not guesses.

## Why Delay?

* Projects change or get shelved.
* Your understanding of the domain improves.
* You may find SQLite or a tiny cloud DB is enough.

Better decisions come from real usage, not assumptions.

## TL;DR

Delay adding tools and libraries as long as possible. Even if you think you’ll need them, wait. You’ll be amazed how far simple can take you.
