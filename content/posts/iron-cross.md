You may have heard of the __"Iron Cross"__.

* __Good__ (Quality)
* (Delivered) __Fast__
* __Cheap__ (Under budget)
* (Everything) __Done__

Focus on any three you like, but you can’t have the fourth.

You can have a project that is __good__ quality, delivered on time __fast__, and within budget and __cheap__. But! not everything will get __done__. 

Or, you can have a project that is all __done__, __cheap__, and __fast__, but it won’t be __good__ quality.

These things are variables. The team needs to determine just how good, how fast, how cheap, and how done the project should be and tweak the variable knobs. 

Good project management means being aware of these variables and in control of the variable knobs.  Bad project management is denying that these variables even exist and just assuming they'll all be maxed out.
