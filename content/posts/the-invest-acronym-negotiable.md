User stories are reminders of features, not full specifications. Avoid recording every detail up front because details change. We'll capture the details later, when they matter.

When a story reads like a contract, it stops being a conversation.
When it reads like a reminder, it invites one.

Follow the acronym "INVEST" as a quick check.

__NEGOTIABLE__

Write stories as negotiable reminders, not fixed contracts.  We leave the details out and create room for conversation.

For example, the business may ask for a fancy drag‑and‑drop UI; builders can propose a simpler checkbox approach that delivers similar value at much lower cost. Those negotiations surface tradeoffs, reveals real costs, and lets the business make informed choices.

Keeping stories negotiable preserves flexibility, speeds decision-making, and prevents premature design lock‑in.

Negotiation is not indecision, it's a structured way to balance value, cost, and risk while keeping delivery focused on what the business actually needs.

__Discussions for your team__
* Are stories written in an open way to enable the team to propose lower‑cost options?
* Are we defining and finalize details to early?
* How will we capture decision details and revise the backlog?
