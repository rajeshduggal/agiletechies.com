Robert C. Martin says that Agile is a small idea about the small problem of small programming teams doing small things.

Agile is not a big idea about the big problem of big programming teams doing big things.

Big things don’t get done by big teams; big things get done by the collaboration of many small teams doing many small things.

To help popularize this, back in the early 2000s, the idea was given a name. “Agile.”

An exercise for your team:

* Ask the team to individually, write a list of all the things in agile that they're not a fan of, or that they disagree with.
* Anonymously compile everyone's list together into one document, and have a meeting to review the list.
* Discuss and cross-reference each list item with what's written on the https://agilemanifesto.org/ website.
