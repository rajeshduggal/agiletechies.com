Want to stop wasting time building the wrong thing. Every iteration ask the stakeholders,

*what should we build next?*

They answer in business-value order, and we implement in that order.

Yes, features have dependencies — we're builders; we handle them. The point is simple: let stakeholders decide priority so the team can focus on delivering value. When stakeholders say a feature is low value, we don't build it yet. When they point to something critical, we give it attention first.

Teams aim to make these trade-offs visible, keep the builders focused, and turn stakeholder priorities into a clear, actionable backlog.

This discipline keeps software development lean, predictable, and aligned with real business need.

Discussions for your team
* Are we asking stakeholders for priorities often enough?
* How do we handle situations where dependencies conflict with priorities?
* How can we enable stakeholders to more quickly change priorities when we have new learnings?
* How can we manage scope-drift better during an iteration?
