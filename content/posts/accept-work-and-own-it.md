As a builder you have the right to accept work, not have it forced on you.

It's OK to kindly refuse it if you don't feel it's appropriate for you and it might better for someone else to take on.

But! When you accept a task, you also accept the responsibility that goes along with it. That means you own the quality and delivery, you keep your estimates up to date, you tell the team the status, and you ask for help when needed.

__Discussions for your team__
* How do we let builders choose to accept or refuse tasks without pressure?
* What do we expect of someone when they accept a task?
* How do we make it easy to ask for help when stuck?
* Who helps decide task assignments?
