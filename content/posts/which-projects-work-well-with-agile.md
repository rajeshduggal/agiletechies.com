Agile works well for projects that have:
* A low cost of change
* Problems that are discovered along the way.
* Informally specified goals, that could alter.

A more traditional approach might be a better option when:
* The cost of change is high.
* The complete set of problems are known up-front.
* The goals are very specific and fully understood from the start.
