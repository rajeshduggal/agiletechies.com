Keep change affordable:
* Short iterations and small stories: Reduce the blast radius of any decision.
* Continuous integration and delivery: Keep the product always releasable so swapping scope is easy.
* Automated tests and refactoring: Make code safe to change; the test suite proves we didn’t break value already delivered.
* Modular architecture and clear seams: Localize change instead of rewriting the world.
* Feature flags and branch-by-abstraction: Enable gradual rollouts and safe reversals.
* Backlog hygiene and ROI-driven ordering: Replace lower-ROI work with higher-ROI work at minimal switching cost.
* WIP limits: Less inventory in flight means less rework when priorities shift.
