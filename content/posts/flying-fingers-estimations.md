Sometimes we just need a quick estimation on something, without asking everyone to use their laptops to login to a website, or passing out estimation cards to everyone.  For this, we can use the simple "flying fingers" technique.

We read the story, discuss it briefly, then each builder hides one hand with their estimation done in "number of fingers" to represent the size.

Someone counts down 3, 2, 1, "Go", and everyone reveals at once.

If the numbers cluster, we take that value and move on; if not, builders explain their views and we retry until we share understanding.

We can also use thumbs down for "zero", thumbs up for "way too long", and an open hand for "Can't estimate. I have questions".
