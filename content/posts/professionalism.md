Agile development prizes discipline over ceremony.

It's a promise to raise our craft and to foster professional behavior across all aspects of software development.

I've seen teams ship junk, and just casually accept defects, and make poor lazy trade-offs. It's surprising to see some of those habits being tolerated at some organizations.

If we want respect for our work, quality and discipline must be nonnegotiable.

__Discussions for your team__
* Are we being professional and constantly finding opportunities to pair, clean out tech debt, and refactor?
* Do our cycles produce quality (almost) bug free output each time?
* What practices are we following to prevent unsafe or low-quality releases?
* How are we guiding our team to continually improve our level of professionalism?
