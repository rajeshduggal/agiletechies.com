Builders shouldn't be put in a position where they're forced to cut corners, rush out sloppy work, or compromise their professional standards. The business does not get to demand low quality or ask others to risk their reputation or ethics for a deadline.

If a task would force someone to do poor work, they must feel safe to raise the issue, explain the risks, and insist on a better alternate approach.

__Discussions for your team__
* Do we ever accept requests that prevents us from doing quality work?  
* What steps do we take when a deadline pressures us to cut corners?  
* Do managers, stakeholders, customers support and encourage builders to push for quality?
