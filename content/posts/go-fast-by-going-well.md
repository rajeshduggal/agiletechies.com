The fastest way to finish is _not_ to cut corners — it's to raise the bar on quality.

Quick‑and‑dirty doesn't speeds things up. __Trash code, missing tests, skipped reviews - they slow the team down.__ When technical debt accumulates, every change takes longer, bugs multiply, and momentum dies.

Instead do things well: keep tests in the flow, do reviews, refactor relentlessly, and protect sustainable work practices. These habits look slower at first, but they pay back quickly in reduced rework and faster, safer delivery.

If your schedule is tight, turn the quality knob up, not down. Protect your core builders, automate wherever possible, and treat quality as the accelerator it really is.

Discussions for your team:
* Which quality practices yield the biggest speed wins?
* Are there some more small, daily habits we can adopt to go well?
