I once worked with a lead that insisted that every story card contain every detail. The cards were filled with tiny paragraphs and became impenetrable. They couldn't be estimated, scheduled, or discarded because so much effort had been spent on each one.

Stories are *placeholders*, not requirements. Write a short name and a few reminders, then save the real conversation for when you’re about to build the feature.

Keep stories cheap so they can be split, merged, changed, or thrown away without regret.

Short, simple stories let the team estimate and schedule work. They force conversation at the right time, reduce waste, and keep the backlog healthy. Resist the urge to document everything up front — flexibility is the point.

Detailed stories are a burden.
