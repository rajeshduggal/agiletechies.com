The "customer" isn't just the person clicking buttons. Generally, the "customer" label can be assigned to **anyone with skin in the game** — end users, managers, executives, project leaders, and anyone carrying responsibility for scheduling, budgets, and outcomes.

Why does this matter?

Because all of these people have legitimate overlapping needs and rights. Which might include:

* The project manager needs a plan.
* The executive needs cost visibility.
* The end user needs working features.
* The product owner needs priority control.

When we treat only one group as "the customer," other voices get ignored and trust breaks down.

__Discussions for your team__
* Are we all clear about who are the project's customers and stakeholders?
* Which customers owns priorities, budget, and acceptance?
* Are the stakeholders able to see progress and costs regularly?
