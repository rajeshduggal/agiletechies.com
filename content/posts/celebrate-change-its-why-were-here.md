We're in this team to make changes. It's not a nuisance - it's the job.

Our careers and our value come from making change cheap and safe.

That means designing for adaptability, writing tests that protect refactors, keeping designs simple, and automating where we can. We celebrate change by making it routine: small batches, continuous refactoring, and visible tests so every builder can evolve the system without fear.

When we make change inexpensive, the business gets faster feedback, customers get better products, and builders do the work we were hired to do.

__Discussions for your team__
* Do we treat change as opportunity or annoyance?
* What new habits and processes can help us make changes even safer?
* What new tests and automation can we put in place to help us reduce the fear of change?
