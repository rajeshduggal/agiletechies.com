(From "Extreme Programming Installed" Addison-Wesley, 2001)

1 You have the right to know what is needed, with clear declarations of priority.

2 You have the right to produce quality work at all times.

3 You have the right to ask for and receive help from peers, superiors, and customers.

4 You have the right to make and update your own estimates.

5 You have the right to accept your responsibilities instead of having them assigned to you.

__Discussions for your team__
* Do the builders know what's needed and what matters most?
* Can the builders refuse to ship crap without fear?
* Is asking for help normalized or stigmatized here?
* Do the builders own their estimates?
* Are tasks assigned or accepted by builders?
