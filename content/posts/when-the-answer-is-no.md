I've joined teams that have a pervasive team culture of always saying "yes" when asked about the feasibility of the schedule, even when the real answer is "no".

As a professional, it's our duty to say "no" when something can't be done. We aren't only hired to deliver, we're also here to surface technical reality. As builders, we are the ones who know whether an approach is feasible or not, and if it can be completed within the allocated timeframe and budget; when it's not, it's vital that we speak up, even when under schedule pressure.

By calling out risks and dangers early and providing solutions and alternatives, we show respect to business, the customers, and the stakeholders by giving them a chance to steer a course away from dangerous cliffs.

__Discussions for the team__
* How do we show, with data, that the reality is a "no"?  
* Does the leadership appreciate and encourage the team to raise concerns?
