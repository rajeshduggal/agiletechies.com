For big tasks I use trivariate estimates - three numbers: **best‑case**, **nominal‑case**, and **worst‑case**. Each number is a confidence estimate:

* **Best‑case (5%)**: only 5% of similar tasks finish this fast.
* **Nominal‑case (50%)**: about half the tasks finish by this time.
* **Worst‑case (95%)**: 95% confidence the task finishes by this time.

For example: "I’m 5% sure we'll finish in 1 week, 50% sure in 2 weeks, and 95% sure in 3 weeks."
That means out of 100 similar tasks, ~5 finish in 1 week, ~50 in 2 weeks, and ~95 in 3 weeks.

Trivariate estimates are great for long‑term planning and showing uncertainty clearly. They let stakeholders make risk‑aware decisions. But they are usually too broad for day‑to‑day work inside a project. For short‑term planning and team flow we can use another approach, _story points_.

__Discussions for your team__
* Which projects need trivariate forecasts vs. simpler ranges?
* How often should we update the three numbers as we learn more?
* How do we present these to stakeholders so they understand risk?
