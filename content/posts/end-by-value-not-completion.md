Your project shouldn't finished when every ticket is implemented.
Instead have in mind to finish it when there are __no more stories worth doing__.

There will come a time when the stakeholders scan the backlog and find that none of the remaining stories are worth doing.

It's not uncommon for an early story's priority to evaporate over time, as higher‑value work is surfaced. That's just fine. 

The team should recognize that when the flow of value has stopped, we can gracefully end the project, instead of chasing backlog completion for its own sake.
