The customers have the right to expect that builders tackle the most important work each cycle and deliver maximum **usable** business value. They choose the stories with the highest return on investment that fit the builders' estimates during planning.

Customers also have the right to see progress in a **running system**, not just slide decks or status reports. They specify the acceptance criteria, and a suite of repeatable tests prove that the criteria is met.

This should be obvious: customers deserve incremental progress they can see, criteria they define, and quick, repeated proof that the work actually works.

__Discussions for your team__
* Are we focused on the highest-ROI stories each iteration?
* Can the customers easily verify that the acceptance criteria are met?
* How often can the customers see new versions of the running software?
* How do we use customer's input to adjust priorities?
